 * describes ONE vault and is stored at `<key>:<vaultId>`, the convention the sync keys already
 * use (sync-keys.ts, docs/multiple-vaults.md). Anything granting a capability against a vault's
 * data is "vault": the two biometric prefs shipped flat, and a second vault then opened with
 * passcode fallback already on, having never been given it.
 *
 * "synced" describes the vault itself, wherever it is opened, and rides in the vault's encrypted
 * payload so it reaches the user's other devices (docs/synced-settings.md). One rule decides
 * eligibility, and it is a constraint rather than a preference:
 *
 *   If anything needs the value while the vault is LOCKED, it cannot be synced.
 *
 * A synced value lives behind the vault key, so it cannot be read before unlock. The extension
 * background reads autoLockMinutes, lockOnScreenLock and autofillEnabled from storage precisely
 * because it must answer while locked, which is why those are device-scoped and must stay so.
 *
 * Exhaustive over `Prefs`, so a new pref cannot be added without deciding - a compile error
 * rather than a silent device-wide default, which is the direction that leaks a permission.
