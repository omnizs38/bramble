/*
 * Build the native-messaging proxy and stage it where Tauri's bundler expects a sidecar.
 *
 * The proxy has to end up in Contents/MacOS, beside the app binary, because that is where
 * manifest.rs looks for it: the host manifest names an absolute path, resolved as a sibling of
 * the running executable. In development both live in target/debug and it works by accident of
 * layout; in a bundle something has to put it there, and that something is Tauri's
 * `externalBin`, which copies each entry into Contents/MacOS.
 *
 * The target-triple suffix is Tauri's convention for choosing the right binary per platform.
 * It strips the suffix when bundling, so `bramble-proxy-aarch64-apple-darwin` here lands as
 * `bramble-proxy` there, which is the name the manifest expects.
 *
 * A universal build needs more than the host slice. Tauri lipos the APP binary itself, but a
 * sidecar is copied, not built, so whatever is staged here is what ships: staging only the host
 * arch produces a universal app whose proxy is Apple Silicon only, and the browser link would
 * simply not work on an Intel Mac.
 *
 * Tauri does not combine them for us. It lipos the app's MAIN binary and nothing else, and the
 * proxy is both a [[bin]] in this crate and an externalBin, so a universal build wants it in two
 * places: `binaries/bramble-proxy-universal-apple-darwin` for the sidecar copy, and
 * `target/universal-apple-darwin/release/bramble-proxy` for the binary copy. Missing either one
 * fails at the bundling step, after everything has been compiled twice.
 *
 * Run automatically by beforeBuildCommand; safe to run by hand.
