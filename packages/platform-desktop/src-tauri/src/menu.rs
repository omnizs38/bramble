//! The application menu. **macOS only.**
//!
//! Built by hand rather than taking `Menu::default`, for two items: an About panel that says who
//! wrote this and under what licence, and a "Check for Updates…" that does not require knowing
//! Settings has an Updates section. Everything else here is the platform's standard menu, rebuilt
//! because customising one submenu means owning the whole bar.
//!
//! Edit is not optional. Without it, Cmd-C and Cmd-V stop working in the webview — in a password
//! manager, of all things. That is a macOS responder-chain requirement and does not transfer:
//! WebKitGTK and WebView2 handle the clipboard keys themselves.
//!
//! Off macOS there is no menu at all. A menu bar there is drawn *inside* the window, so it spends
//! a strip of a small window on File > Quit (the tray has it), Window > Minimize (the title bar
//! has it) and About plus Check for Updates, both of which are in Settings. macOS is the one
//! platform where the bar belongs to the screen rather than the window, and so costs nothing.
//!
//! macOS renders only some of `AboutMetadata`: name, version, short_version, copyright, icon and
//! credits. `authors`, `license` and `website` are accepted and silently dropped, so everything
//! worth showing goes through `credits` instead. It renders as plain text, so the source URL is
//! selectable rather than clickable.
