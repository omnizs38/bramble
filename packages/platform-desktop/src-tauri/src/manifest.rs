//! Installing the native-messaging host manifest.
//!
//! Chrome will only spawn a host it has a manifest for, and only for the extension ids that
//! manifest names. The file is per-browser, per-user, and carries an ABSOLUTE path to the
//! proxy binary, which is what makes this more than a one-time install step: move the app or
//! update it and every manifest is stale, with the extension failing to connect and nothing
//! saying why. So they are rewritten on every launch rather than written once.
//!
//! Only browsers that are already installed get one. The directory is created if missing, but
//! the browser's own support directory is never conjured up: writing a Brave profile
//! directory onto a machine with no Brave would be presumptuous and would leave litter behind
//! that nothing ever cleans up.
//!
//! Two mechanisms. macOS and Linux drop a JSON file into each browser's own profile
//! directory. Windows keeps the same JSON in ONE place and has each browser's registry key
//! point at it, because that is what Chromium reads there: `HKCU\Software\<vendor>\<browser>
//! \NativeMessagingHosts\<host>`, whose default value is the path to the file. So the Windows
//! table is a path AND a key, and `install_all` writes a value rather than a file.
//!
//! Firefox is absent on all three: it reads a different manifest schema from a different
//! location, and the Firefox build of the extension declares `nativeMessaging` in neither
//! permission array, so a host manifest for it would be something no browser would ever act
//! on. See docs/desktop-port.md.
//!
//! Nothing here depends on HOW the Chromium extension holds that permission. It is optional there
//! now, asked for when the user connects rather than at install, but this file keys on the
//! extension id and a browser refuses an unpermitted `connectNative` before any manifest is
//! consulted. So a manifest written for a browser that has not been granted it yet is harmless
//! and correct: it is what makes the connection work the moment the user says yes.
//! See docs/desktop-link-optional-permission.md.
