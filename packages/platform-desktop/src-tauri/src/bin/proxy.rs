//! The native-messaging host Chrome spawns, and a pure byte pump.
//!
//! Native messaging inverts the lifecycle: the browser starts its host, but Bramble is
//! already running. So this relays between the browser's stdio and the app's local socket.
//! Both sides use the same framing (4-byte little-endian length, then JSON), so this never
//! parses a message, which is the point: it holds no key and cannot read or alter the Noise
//! session running through it. Replacing this binary gains an attacker nothing.
//!
//! Deliberately does not link the app library. The browser spawns this on every launch, so it
//! stays small and starts fast; pulling in Tauri to learn one path would be absurd.
//!
//! Chrome passes the calling extension's origin as argv[1]. It is not forwarded, because a
//! local process can run this binary directly with any argv it likes, so it would be no more
//! trustworthy than the label the extension already sends. It is left available for a future
//! parent-process check, which is the version of this that would carry weight. See
//! docs/desktop-port.md.
