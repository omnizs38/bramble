//! seed it signs roster entries with. Mobile keeps the same two in the Keychain/Keystore for
//! the same reason: only their PUBLIC halves ever leave the device, so the private halves have
//! no business sitting in a readable file next to the vault.
//!
//! Reads are cached, and that is not an optimisation. macOS ties a keychain item's ACL to the

//! recognise every read is a password prompt; reading per operation turned a working feature
//! into a wall of them once already. An absent value is cached too, since that is just as
//! stable a fact as a present one.
