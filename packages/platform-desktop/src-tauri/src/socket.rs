//! The local socket the browser proxy connects to.
//!
//! Native messaging inverts the lifecycle: the browser *spawns* its host, but this app is
//! resident. So a small spawned proxy relays between the browser's stdio and this socket, and
//! this is the resident end of that pipe.
//!
//! The socket is the reason pairing exists. Owner-only permissions keep other accounts out,
//! but every process running as the user can connect, so reaching this listener proves
//! nothing on its own. Authentication is entirely the Noise handshake in `pairing`: a caller
//! that cannot complete it gets no further, and the proxy itself holds no key, which is what
//! reduces it to an untrusted relay. See docs/desktop-port.md.
//!
//! Framing is a 4-byte little-endian length followed by JSON, the same shape Chrome's native
//! messaging uses, so the proxy can pump bytes between the two without parsing anything.
