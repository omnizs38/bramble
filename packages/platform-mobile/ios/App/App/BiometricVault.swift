// Local Capacitor plugin: caches the vault VEK in the Keychain behind an OS-enforced
// biometric gate. The caller picks the gate per call via `allowPasscode` (the
// "Allow passcode fallback" setting):
//   true  -> .userPresence, released by Face ID / Touch ID OR the device passcode. The only
//            gate a passcode-only device can use.
//   false -> .biometryCurrentSet, biometry only. The item is destroyed by the OS whenever an
//            enrolled face/finger changes, so someone holding the device passcode can't enrol
//            their own biometry and walk in. Matches what Android has always done.
// The ACL is fixed at write time, so the setting is applied by re-arming (see setSecret).
// We never run Argon2 here; this is the device-local convenience-unlock cache described in
// docs/mobile-port.md (Phase 2) and docs/auth-and-unlock.md.
