# Field detection

How Bramble decides which inputs on a page are a username, password, card field,
OTP box, or custom field. Code: `packages/platform-extension/src/content/detection.ts`,
exercised by real-site fixtures in `fixtures/sites.dom.test.ts`. How the detected
fields are filled is in [autofill.md](autofill.md).

## Pure DOM helpers

Every function here is a pure DOM query: no module state, no event listeners
(content-script.ts owns those). Each takes an optional `doc` argument so the
detectors can be tested against HTML fixtures without touching the live document.

A recurring pattern is the **attributes-then-label ladder**: a field's own
attributes (`name`, `id`, `placeholder`, `autocomplete`, `aria-label`) are the
higher-priority hint; the associated `<label>` text (explicit `for=`, wrapping
`<label>`, `aria-labelledby`) is a lower-priority fallback for forms whose only
human-readable hint lives in the label.

## What a parse costs

The rungs below add up to about twenty selectors, and running each as its own DOM
traversal is what made the extension a browsing tax: a YouTube watch page (50k
elements, 2 inputs) cost ~675ms per parse, twice a second, in every frame
(issue #59). Two rules keep it flat:

- **One collection per parse.** `createScan()` gathers every `input` once, in
  DFS pre-order, and every rung filters that list. Selector work now tracks the
  number of inputs, not the size of the page.
- **Native queries unless the page uses shadow DOM.** `deepQueryAll` crosses open
  shadow roots, which `querySelectorAll` cannot, but only pages that actually
  have a root pay for the hand-written walk. Whether one exists is a memoized
  census (one TreeWalker pass), dropped by `invalidatePageFields()`.

Both orders are the same pre-order - the element, then its shadow content, then
its light children - because rung 1 pairs a username with the password it
precedes. `detection.shadow.dom.test.ts` pins the two paths to one reference
walk, and `detection.perf.dom.test.ts` fails if selector work starts scaling with
page size again.

## Username and login fields

`detectLoginFields` resolves the username via a five-rung ladder, stopping at the
first hit:

1. The password's nearest preceding text input in DOM order (most reliable).
2. An explicit `autocomplete~="username"` or `autocomplete="email"`.
3. A single visible email input.
4. Attribute heuristics on text inputs (`USERNAME_HINT_RE`).
5. Associated `<label>` text.

Negative hints (`search`, `captcha`, `coupon`, `otp`, `code`) filter out
look-alikes at each rung, and carry localized search terms. Those matter more
than they look: rung 1 takes the password's nearest preceding text input, so an
untranslated search box in the header wins and the username gets typed into it.

Rungs 1 to 3 are language-free and carry ordinary login forms on any site. Rungs
4 and 5 read prose, so `USERNAME_HINT_RE` carries localized identifier terms
(issue #46). They decide only the shape rung 1 cannot help with: an
**identifier-first** page, where the password lives on a later step and there is
no password field to anchor to.

Two rules keep that list from doing damage. Every term must stand alone, so the
"name" half of *nom d'utilisateur* / *nombre de usuario* is deliberately absent —
a bare "name" would claim every cardholder and full-name field. And short ASCII
terms are `\b`-bounded, so Portuguese `conta` cannot match `contact`; non-Latin
terms are not, because `\b` is ASCII-only and CJK has no word separators.
Accented forms are alternated with their stripped spelling, since `name`/`id`
attributes usually drop the diacritic while the visible label keeps it.

Exercised by `content/detection.i18n.dom.test.ts`, which tests both directions:
missing a username costs autofill, but claiming the wrong field types the login
into a search box, which is worse.

### One document, two credential forms

Every rung prefers a field that is **on screen**, and only falls back to a hidden
one when no rung finds a visible candidate. Plenty of sites ship the login and
register forms together and swap between them by class — login.gog.com puts the
register form first in DOM order, hidden by `._modal__box{display:none}`, and the
login form second with `.is-active`. First-in-DOM-order lands every detector in
whichever form is closed: the fill goes into boxes nobody can see, and the visible
username input, being neither the model's username nor a password, classifies as
nothing at all, so no dropdown ever appears on it (`gog-login-frame`).

Visibility is CSS only (`display` / `visibility` / `opacity`, ancestors included),
never geometry, and the fallback matters as much as the preference: a step-2
password box a script reveals later, or a field parsed before layout, is still the
field we want when it is the only one there is. `checkVisibility` answers all three
in one call where it exists; the walk up the ancestors is for engines without it
(jsdom), because an element inside a `display:none` subtree still reports its own
declared `display`.

## Card fields

`detectCardFields` is token-first: it prefers proper `autocomplete="cc-*"` tokens
and falls back to regex hints. A combined MM/YY field is only treated as present
when there is no split month/year pair, avoiding double-fill. A bare cardholder
name is too weak a signal on its own, so `cardFieldsPresent` requires a real card
field (number, CVV, or expiry) before the card picker is offered.

The number has a third pass behind those two, for names that are unambiguous **on
a card form** and meaningless anywhere else. `pan` is the one that matters: it is
the payment industry's Primary Account Number and what PCI capture iframes call
the field, but it is also India's Permanent Account Number, on every KYC form
there. So `CC_NUMBER_WEAK_RE` is consulted only when `cardContextPresent` finds
independent evidence — another detected card field, or an input whose name gives
the card schema away (`CC_CONTEXT_RE`).

That context check is the one place detection reads **hidden** inputs. A PCI
capture frame carries its transport schema in them (`sf.req.card.expiryMonth`,
`cardScheme`), which is exactly the evidence wanted, and reading them is safe
precisely because no targeting pass will look at them: `findByHint` skips
`type=hidden`, so a hidden `expiryDate` names the room without ever becoming a
fill target. Same two-tier reasoning as `CC_CSC_RE`, which requires card context
for the opposite reason — "verification code" alone is far more often 2FA.

## OTP fields

`otpInputs` runs a four-rung ladder, strongest first:

1. `autocomplete~="one-time-code"` tokens. Several matches means a segmented
   widget tagging every box, so all of them are returned.
2. Attribute then label hints (`OTP_HINT_RE`), excluding card, coupon, promo,
   postal, address and redeemable-code fields (`OTP_NEGATIVE_RE`). A matched
   single-character input is one box of a **segmented widget**, so the contiguous
   run of single-character siblings is gathered (`segmentedSiblings`). The word
   "code" on its own (`WEAK_CODE_RE`) is too common to trust, so it only counts
   when the field is also length-bounded like a code.
3. **Structural:** an untagged run of `SEGMENTED_MIN_BOXES` (4) or more
   single-character inputs sharing a parent. Nothing else on the web is shaped
   like that, and it needs no readable text.
4. **Structural:** a lone digits-only field of code length (`maxlength` 4-8 plus
   `inputmode`/`type`/`pattern` evidence). The weakest rung, so it fires only
   when exactly one field qualifies; more than one and we'd be guessing which box
   the code belongs in.

Rungs 3 and 4 exist because rung 2 only covers languages someone thought to add.
Issue #47 was reported as broken TOTP autofill on Microsoft and otto.de; a corpus
of 17 realistic 2FA shapes found only 4 detected, and the misses were every
localized phrasing of "verification code" plus every untagged segmented widget.
The corpus is now `content/detection.otp.dom.test.ts` — add rows there rather
than editing the regex blind.

A "single-character box" (`isSingleCharBox`) is a text-like input that takes one
character, said with `maxlength="1"` **or** with a one-character `pattern`.
Cloudflare's 2FA form is the reason for the second: none of its boxes carry a
`maxlength` at all except the first, which takes `maxlength="6"` so an OS-level
code autofill can drop the whole code into it. Each box declares its width as
`pattern="\d{1}"` instead.

`splitOtpFields` then divides what the ladder found into the **boxes** a code is
typed across and the one field that holds it **whole**. Segmented widgets
increasingly ship both: N visible boxes plus a visually-hidden input carrying the
assembled code for the form (and for OS code autofill). That mirror answers the
same `one-time-code` query as the boxes, so it used to be filled as if it were
another box, receiving one character of the code, or the empty string past the
end of it. On a widget that reads the mirror as its source of truth, that empty
write resets the widget immediately after a correct fill, which is how
Cloudflare's 2FA screen ended up reported as "autofill does nothing". How each is
written is in [autofill.md](autofill.md).

`OTP_HINT_RE` also carries localized terms, and bounds `otp`/`otc`/`totp` on
letters rather than `\b` so they match inside `idTxtBx_SAOTCC_OTC`, where the
underscore is a word character and `\b` fails. Android's `StructureParser.kt`
holds its own copy of these heuristics and is **not** kept in sync
automatically.

Rung 1 is the strongest and also the most brittle, because it rests on a single
attribute: anything that removes `one-time-code` from a box removes that box from
the model. That included **us** for a while, since the picker wrote
`autocomplete="off"` on the field it anchored to (see
[autofill.md](autofill.md)). Worse, on a segmented widget the other boxes keep
their tokens, so rung 1 still succeeds and the structural rungs that would have
caught the whole run never run.

Visibility is deliberately not filtered here, matching the rest of the module, so
a hidden 2FA field on a login step is still found (see the skanetrafiken
fixture). That is harmless: `kindOf` ranks OTP last, so login and card fields
still win.

## Captcha

`hasInteractiveCaptcha` matches only **interactive** challenge widgets (reCAPTCHA
v2, hCaptcha, Turnstile, Arkose/FunCaptcha, and the relevant iframes). Invisible,
score-based checks (reCAPTCHA v3) are deliberately excluded because they do not
block submission. `isRendered` filters out 0x0 containers and
`display:none`/`visibility:hidden`/`opacity:0` elements, so an invisible token
field is not mistaken for an interactive challenge. Auto-submit must not fire when
an interactive captcha is present.

## Field-kind precedence

`candidateKind` classifies a single element as `login`, `card`, `otp`, or null.
The load-bearing rule: **login wins over card**, except CVV-as-password. So a
field that satisfies the login detector is treated as a login even when its label
says "card number" (real example: banks like BMO where the username *is* the
debit card number). The one exception is a `type=password` CVV on a real payment
form, which is classified as a card field.

## Custom fields

A custom field carries a user-chosen name like "Postal code". `deriveMatcher`
normalizes it into a canonical form (`postalcode`) and a hyphen form
(`postal-code`) for flexible token matching. Matching tries the autocomplete
token first, then attributes, then the label. Exact normalized matches count at
any length, but substring matches require a key of 5+ characters so short names
like "name" or "city" cannot match "username" or "velocity".

Custom fields fill text-like inputs only (`CUSTOM_FILLABLE_TYPES`). Password and
email are explicitly excluded, so a stray custom match cannot dump a value into a
credential or email field. Custom fields are also lowest priority overall: they
never fill a detected primary field.

## Password-change forms

`findNewPasswordOnChangeForm` returns the new-password field only when the form is
unambiguous: 2+ password fields, one confidently identified as new (via
`autocomplete="new-password"` or a `new`/`set` hint, and not matching
old/current/confirm/verify/repeat), and its value matches a confirm field. If the
form is ambiguous or mid-edit it returns null rather than guessing, so an
unconfirmed password is never captured.

## Signup detection

`signup-detect.ts` decides whether a focused password field belongs to a flow that
**sets** a password (signup, password reset, forced rotation, or a change-password
form) so the autofill dropdown can offer a **generated strong password**
(`password-gen.ts`) without firing on ordinary login pages. See
[autofill.md](autofill.md) for the dropdown row and the save/update flow.

The design principle is to lean on **language-independent structural signals** so
non-English pages work without reading their prose. `scoreSignupForm` sums
weighted signals (all in `WEIGHTS`, tune there) and offers above `THRESHOLD`
(100):

- **Strong (each reaches the threshold alone):** `autocomplete="new-password"` on
  the field, a confirm-password pair (2+ non-current password fields in scope), or
  a change form (a `current-password` sibling while the focused field is not it,
  marking the focused field as the new password to rotate to).
- **Supporting (structural, language-independent):** a terms/privacy link or agree
  checkbox in the form, a name field (`given-name`/`family-name`), a password policy
  on the field (`pattern`, `minlength>=8`, or Safari's `passwordrules`), a strength
  meter (`<meter>`/`role=progressbar`), an identified account (below), and a long
  form (>4 inputs).
- **Supporting (text, boosters only):** the URL path (`/signup`, `/register`, …), a
  small multilingual keyword dictionary matched against submit buttons, headings and
  the title, and a set-password keyword on the form's own submit control.
- **Negative:** login URLs, "forgot password"/"remember me" text, and a
  returning-user damper when the site already has saved logins.

The negatives describe the **page** (its route, its surrounding prose), so all three
are skipped when a strong structural signal describes the **form**. A rendered
confirm pair means two password boxes to set, and no login form has two; the route
and the heading are then talking about the shell around the form, not the form. This
is what a reset link needs, because it routinely lands on `/auth/…` under a heading
that says "forgot password" — that combination alone used to cost 75 points and sink
an otherwise unambiguous form.

Two smaller surfaces matter more than they look. Design-system forms often render a
floating label and a generic submit ("Continue") while the real intent sits in
`title` / `aria-label`, so this module reads a wider hint surface than `attrHint`
gives it (which stays narrow because card and OTP detection share it, where tooltips
are noise). And the set-password keyword list is matched **only against the form's
own submit controls**, never page text: a login page links to "reset password" all
the time, but a login form's own button never says it. The terms pair a verb with the
noun for the same reason — a bare "password" would match the "Show password" toggle
that sits inside plenty of login forms.

The veto is narrow: only when the **focused** field is itself a `current-password`
(a login field, or the "old password" box on a change form) do we suppress. A
`current-password` *sibling* is not a veto but a change-form signal (above), so the
new-password field of a change form still gets the offer. The scope is the field's
enclosing `<form>` when present, else the document; visibility is gated by
`isRendered`, so a display:none honeypot password field can't fabricate a confirm
pair. The offer is also suppressed once the field holds a value (the user is typing
their own). Exercised by `signup-detect.dom.test.ts`.

### Setting a password is not creating an account

Offering a generated password and deciding what to do with the result are separate
questions. `isAccountCreationForm` answers the second, and the caller uses it to
force a fresh save **past dedupe** — because signing up a second time on a site you
already have a login for really is a new credential.

Setting a password is not. A reset link, a forced rotation and a change form all set
a password on an account that already exists, so they route through dedupe instead,
which offers "Update" when a saved login matches and "Save" when none does. (The
update prompt still carries a "Save as new" button, so the user can overrule it
either way.) Forcing a save there duplicates the saved login, which is what happens
if the only test is "no current-password box" — a reset form doesn't have one.

The discriminator is whether the form still asks **who you are**:
`hasIdentifiedAccount` looks for a username/email field the user could fill in, and
finds none when it is absent, `readonly`, `disabled`, hidden, or parked off-screen.
That last case is the WHATWG-recommended reset pattern — a `autocomplete="username"`
companion at `position:absolute; left:-9999px`, there so password managers can
associate the credential — and `isRendered` cannot see it, since the box has real
dimensions and is neither `display:none` nor transparent. `isOffscreen` compares in
**document** coordinates so a field merely scrolled out of view still counts as
on-screen. The check deliberately ignores `value`: a signup form's email is populated
the moment the user types it.

`isOnAccountCreationForm` turns the same answer around for the form's **other**
fields. There is nothing in an email box that says "signup", so it puts the question
to that form's own new-password field instead. The content script uses it to keep the
picker off the rest of a signup form entirely — see [autofill.md](autofill.md), "The
rest of an account-creation form offers nothing".

When the form has no password box at all — a registration split across steps, which
invents the credential on the next screen — it falls back to a **confirm-email
pair**: two rendered, editable email boxes in scope. Structural and
language-independent like the confirm-password pair, and decisive for the same
reason: a login form asks who you are once, and so does the email screen of a
two-step login. Only a form making an account has you type it twice. A
`current-password` box anywhere in scope vetoes it outright.

Nothing else is allowed to decide this. The page-level signals score a two-step
login's email screen exactly like a signup's — a `/signin` route under a heading with
a "Create account" link — and unlike the password offer, being wrong here is
**silent**: the picker simply never appears on the screen where autofill is worth the
most. The pair is also the email vocabulary only, not the whole of
`USERNAME_HINT_RE`, which carries "account" and "user": an account-number box beside
an email box is not a signup.

## Fixtures

`fixtures/sites.dom.test.ts` runs the detectors against real HTML captured from
sites (GitHub, BMO, Discord, Twitch, Amazon, Microsoft, Skånetrafiken, and
others). This locks in behaviour on real-world quirks: honeypots, off-screen
hidden fields, missing `<form>` wrappers, custom component libraries, GitHub's
tokenless `name="otp"` 2FA field, BMO's card-number-as-login, and invisible
Turnstile that must not block autofill.

`gog-login-frame` is the twin-forms case above, captured from the cross-origin
iframe that is the whole of gog.com's sign-in UI. It carries the class rules that
hide one of the two forms in a `<style>` block, since jsdom loads no external CSS,
and it drives the swap in both directions: activate the register box instead and
the detectors follow it.

`semafone-card-frame` is the unlabelled-card-field case: a cross-origin PCI
capture iframe whose number box is a bare `name="pan"` with no label, placeholder,
autocomplete or aria-label. The only prose that names it is the parent page's
`<iframe title="Enter credit card number">`, which the frame cannot read. Drawing
the picker over a frame that short was already handled by the relay
(`needsRelay`); detection was the whole blocker.

That page also splits the card across frames: the number is inside the iframe
while expiry and CVV sit in the parent. Each frame runs its own content script and
its own `AUTOFILL_SELECT` round-trip, so a pick fills the fields in the frame it
was made from and no others, and the user completes the form with one pick per
frame. That is deliberate, not a gap. Filling across frames would mean either
routing the card over the relay -- which carries geometry and an opaque id only,
never secrets, and where a hostile frame could forge the trigger -- or having the
background fan the payload out to sibling frames, which puts the number and CVV
into every same-site frame that *claims* a card form, a claim nothing can verify.
The invariant is worth more than the second click: a card is only ever written
into the frame the user acted in.

`angular-ds-set-password` is the set-password class at its most awkward, and the
form the suggestion used to miss: `autocomplete="off"` on the form and no
`new-password` token, no current-password box, no `minlength`, no `pattern`, no
`<meter>`, a submit that reads "Continue", and the only statements of intent in
`title` attributes and an off-screen username companion.

`cloudflare-2fa` is the segmented-widget shape in full: six boxes with no
`maxlength`, a hidden mirror, and `autocomplete="one-time-code"` on all seven.
`content/fill.otp.dom.test.ts` fills it, and fills widget doubles that each
accept a different write (a character at a time, the whole code, a paste, the
mirror only).

`skanetrafiken-login` is the counter-example worth keeping in mind: it was
reported as a non-English detection failure (issue #46), but the site ships
correct `autocomplete` tokens, so the Swedish labels are never consulted and both
fields resolve on rung 1. What actually failed there was save capture, not
detection, and the same fixture drives `content/capture.dom.test.ts`. The
language gap is real but lives elsewhere: rungs 4 and 5 are English-only, so a
non-English **two-step** page (identifier first, no password field yet) resolves
no username at all, and `NEGATIVE_HINT_RE` misses non-English search boxes.
