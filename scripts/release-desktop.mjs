// Build and assemble a GitHub release for the desktop app: the .dmg people download, the .tar.gz
// the in-app updater downloads, and the latest.json that points at it.
//
// Usage:
//   pnpm package:desktop              build (universal) and assemble
//   pnpm package:desktop --aarch64    Apple Silicon only, for iterating
//   pnpm package:desktop --resume     assemble what is already built, no rebuild
//
// For a real release use `pnpm release desktop <version>`, which bumps, tags, publishes, and
// commits the manifest in the order that keeps the update channel honest. This is the packaging
// half of that, usable on its own.
//
// It builds rather than assuming a build, the way the other targets do. Assembling from whatever
// happened to be in the bundle directory is how a release ends up carrying an artifact from an
// older commit, and the signature in latest.json would still verify against it — the manifest
// would be internally consistent and simply describe the wrong software.
//
// The updater endpoint is this file on the website, so it IS the update channel. Getting it wrong
// does not break the download, it breaks updating for everyone already running the app, which is
// the failure nobody notices until it matters. It is served from bramble.sh rather than the
// GitHub release because `/releases/latest` means the newest release of ANY target, and this repo
// ships chromium, firefox and android from the same tag namespace — the next extension release
// would quietly point every desktop install at a 404.
//
// Reads what the build actually produced rather than reconstructing names, because the signature
// has to belong to the exact bytes being published.
