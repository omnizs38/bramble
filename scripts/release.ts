// commit list, because a release must never block on a summary.
//
// The version arg is an explicit version (1.2.0 / v1.2.0) or a semver bump keyword
// (patch/minor/major) that increments the SELECTED target's current version. Targets version
// independently, so `android patch` and `chromium patch` can land on different numbers.
//
// Tags as <version>-<platform> (e.g. 1.0.0-chromium, 1.0.0-firefox, 1.1.0-android, 1.1.0-ios).
// chromium/firefox/android publish a GitHub release; publishing fires
// .github/workflows/release.yml, which only verifies the artifact made it onto the release (CI
// never builds or signs). chromium packs a locally-signed .crx; firefox uploads to AMO and
// attaches the Mozilla-signed .xpi it returns. ios has no GitHub release: the binary goes to
// TestFlight via fastlane, and you submit for App Store review manually in App Store Connect.
// android builds here on macOS (web bundle + Rust FFI + gradle assembleRelease) and signs the
// unsigned APK gradle emits with the YubiKey-held keystore. Signing setup lives in
// docs/release-signing.md.
// desktop publishes a GitHub release AND commits the updater manifest to the website, in that
// order — the manifest is the live update channel, so it must never name artifacts that are not
// there yet.
